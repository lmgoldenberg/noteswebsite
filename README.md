This is not a substitute for reading the textbooks for these courses. Please read the textbook and use my notes as a supplement. I am not responsible in the event of any wrong or outdated information (though atleast 99% of this should be accurate, mistakes happen and classes get updated). These notes are based off of the 2024-2025 academic year version of these textbooks, and full credit goes to Professor Hao and Professor Bonelli for the textbooks themselves. Many times in my notes I just copy paste from the textbook without proper citation because these notes are informal.
